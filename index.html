Welcome to my website. I have a PhD in Environmental Toxicology and study the interactions between plastic and the environment (ecology and human health). I currently serve as a Research Scientist at the California State Water Resources Control Board, where I am the lead technical scientist for the development of microplastics regulations in drinking water.
