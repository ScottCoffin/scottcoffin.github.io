Welcome to my website! <br>
<br>

I have a PhD in Environmental Toxicology and study the interactions between plastic and the environment (ecology and human health).<br>
<br>

I currently serve as a Research Scientist at the <a href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/">California State Water Resources Control Board</a>, where I am the lead technical scientist for the development of <a href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/microplastics.html">microplastics regulations in drinking water.</a> <br>
<br>

I am also currently serving as a Topic Editor for two research topics for the open-access Frontiers journals, including addressing <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/31636/alternatives-to-petroleum-based-plastics-as-a-potential-solution-to-the-global-plastic-pollution-cri"> Alternatives to petroleum-based plastics as a potential solution to the global plastic pollution crisis in marine environments: Do they provide sustainable solutions?</a> and <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/22088/microplastics-in-water-and-potential-impacts-on-human-health">Microplastics in Water and Potential Impacts on Human Health</a> <br>
<br>

I am committed to making data and science open to the extent possible, which is why this <a href="https://github.com/ScottCoffin/scottcoffin.github.io"> entire website is open-source</a> and may be freely copied by anyone who so wishes.
