Welcome to my website! <br>
<br>

I have a PhD in Environmental Toxicology and study the interactions between toxics and the environment (ecology and human health).<br>
<br>

I currently serve as a Research Scientist at the <a href="https://oehha.ca.gov/">California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment</a>, where I develop and apply new approach methods to assess the hazards of chemicals with little or no animal toxicity testing data.</a> <br>
<br>

In addition to my duties at OEHHA, I serve various roles in different organization. I am an editor for <a href ="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-prisms-plastics"> Cambridge Prisms: Plastics</a>, and a Topic Editor for two research topics for the open-access Frontiers journals, including addressing <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/31636/alternatives-to-petroleum-based-plastics-as-a-potential-solution-to-the-global-plastic-pollution-cri"> Alternatives to petroleum-based plastics as a potential solution to the global plastic pollution crisis in marine environments: Do they provide sustainable solutions?</a> and <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/22088/microplastics-in-water-and-potential-impacts-on-human-health">Microplastics in Water and Potential Impacts on Human Health</a>. Additionally I am a board member of the <a href = "https://mooreplasticresearch.org/" >Moore Institute for Plastic Pollution Research</a> - which is a 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to tackling the plastic pollution crisis with scientific research & innovation. I am also one of the founders of <a href ="https://www.plastiverse.org/">Plastiverse.org</a> - a community hub for assets and information exchange of plastic pollution research. <br>
<br>

I am committed to making data and science open to the extent possible, which is why this <a href="https://github.com/ScottCoffin/scottcoffin.github.io"> entire website is open-source</a> and may be freely copied by anyone who so wishes.
